# MoveMe
MoveMe was created to provide people easy access to find and join political or community events. Users are prompted to enter his/her zipcode and MoveMe will generate upcoming events from the meetup.com and the location from Google Maps. We have also created a chat feature for MoveMe users to connect with other users online.

## Getting Started

Open up the [project link](https://github.com/sun1devil/MoveMe) and you should be able to see the example webpage shown below:

![Homepage](assets/images/Homepage.PNG) "MoveMe Homepage")
![Upcoming Events](assets/images/upcoming-events.PNG "MoveMe Upcoming Events Results")

Enter your preferred user name and join others in the timeless game of Rock Paper Scissors. Once you're at the head of the queue, you'll gain access to the chat and face off against another player! See how many wins you can achieve and how many players you can defeat.
